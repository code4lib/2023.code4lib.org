---
Are you tired of building one-off scripts to process your data? Does copying and pasting snippets of code to patch together yet another script make you want to scream? Well, have I got news for you! Introducing: Thor. No, not the Hemsworth with the hammer; the gem worth its weight in empowering you to build and organize reusable metadata processes.  In this presentation I'll demonstrate what Thor, the flexible command line interface toolkit, has to offer to make your next metadata project a breeze*.


\* or at least less of a headache.
