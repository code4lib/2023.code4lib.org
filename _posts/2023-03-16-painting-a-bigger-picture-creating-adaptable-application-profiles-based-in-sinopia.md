title: "Painting A Bigger Picture: Creating Adaptable Application Profiles based in Sinopia"
---
LD4P’s Sinopia Linked Data Environment has become a valuable resource for creating RDA/RDF encoded
metadata, but just as sinopias were precursors to fully-fledged frescoes, the Sinopia Environment
is only an introduction to what is possible for linked data in library science. The University of
Washington Library’s Linked Data team has been developing a workflow to create Sinopia resource
templates outside of the Sinopia interface using XML and Python. The Sinopia MAPs project stores
the data necessary to create these resource templates in a GitHub repository, creating a single
source that can be used to produce multiple derivatives including Sinopia resource templates,
human-readable HTML templates, and potentially other representations, such as DC Tabular
Application Profiles in the form of CSV files. By using a workflow outside of Sinopia, property
templates can be referenced and reused across multiple application profiles, meaning a single line
of code can create a whole new resource template. This project is an exploration in designing
platform-agnostic metadata application profiles that can be easily adapted and used to create
templates in a variety of formats to support the production of resource descriptions in RDA/RDF.
