Artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere, and its applications are part of our daily lives; More and more Libraries do machine learning too!  A Computer Science instructor and a certificated TensorFlow developer will lead this three-hour workshop. Participants will first learn the fundamental knowledge of machine learning and some AI use cases and applications. The second part of the workshop will introduce TensorFlow. Participants will learn how to build a neural network, train, evaluate and optimize machine learning models, and use built models to predict new data.  No complicated algorithms or math. Just do coding! All are welcome.
