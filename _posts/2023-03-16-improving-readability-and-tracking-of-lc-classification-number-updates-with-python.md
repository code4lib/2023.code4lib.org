title: "Improving Readability and Tracking of LC Classification Number Updates with Python"
---
Every month, the Library of Congress releases changes and additions to LC classification numbers
published to classweb.org/approved/. Most recently, the Library of Congress has begun releasing
changed classification patterns for outdated and/or harmful racial and ethnic group terms. NCSU
Libraries has an interest in tracking and implementing these changes locally. We explored how to
process these monthly lists using Python to filter the monthly results into a more readable
spreadsheet for us to review and implement changes as they appear. Using regular expressions, HTTP
requests, and Pandas, we successfully created a script that exports these lists into a multi-tab
spreadsheet for users to track and execute all applicable changes in a more readable, easy to use
format.
