title: "There’s going to be some changes: Developing support, supporting developers, and supporting development. "
---
When faced with a wide range of upgrade-related changes to our digital preservation system, the library’s Digital Preservation Unit was charged with supporting stakeholders with varying needs through the transition. What from the outset seemed to be a straight-forward task of creating documentation and informing users, quickly expanded to include extensive testing, providing support to the developers of various integrations, and developing new user-facing software ourselves. This presentation will provide a number of lessons-learned along the path from getting up-to-speed with a large number of system changes, finding our edge-cases as early as possible, working with internal and external developers, the development of our packaging application and the technology choices that enabled it.
