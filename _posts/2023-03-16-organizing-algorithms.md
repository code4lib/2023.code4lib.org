title: "Organizing Algorithms"
---
The application of machine learning algorithms in libraries and information organizations is a
topic of growing importance to the information science community. The inverse, though, is much
less discussed. This poster explores current applications of best practices in information
organization to algorithm environments. As the number of low-technical users of algorithms and
their associated output continues to grow, adherence to standards of information organization is
becoming increasingly important. Current standards, such as generous tools and FAIR data
principles, are discussed to evaluate current algorithm environments. GitHub and Hugging Face
serve as primary examples to show how current platforms meet and fall short of these standards. I
find several opportunities for improvement in the organization of information on these platforms,
including leveraging contributions from existing open-source communities.
