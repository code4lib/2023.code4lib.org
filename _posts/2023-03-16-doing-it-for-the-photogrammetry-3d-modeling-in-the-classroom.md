title: "Doing it for the Photogrammetry: 3D modeling in the classroom"
---
This poster will provide an overview of a photogrammetry assignment developed as part of an
Introduction to Digital Humanities class. This session was a partnership between Special
Collections and Digital Initiatives librarians and allowed students to experiment with 3D modeling
artifacts housed in special collections. Students used their phones and 3D Zephyr to photograph
and process their models which were then uploaded to Sketchfab. Students received hands-on
experience working with the artifacts and transferable digital skills that are part of
professional cultural heritage institutions’s digital practices. Students also had the opportunity
to partner with special collections collaborators such as The Byron Society of America to envision
ways of making their realia collections more public-facing and accessible. This activity was part
of the course’s image and archives unit and also helped make explicit themes and theories explored
within the class related to close looking, the uncanny, and digital preservation.
