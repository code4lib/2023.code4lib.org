title: "Assessing open source and subscription data sources for research information management and evaluation"
---
Academic libraries are increasingly called upon to capture and use publication metadata to
demonstrate the productivity and impact of the institution's researchers. But not all data sources
are created equal. This poster will describe a case study involving a research impact assessment
using four metadata sources, including two open source and two subscription based solutions. It
will compare the different data sources, assessing the benefits and drawbacks of each, and the
impact of data source selection on the results of a research impact assessment project.
