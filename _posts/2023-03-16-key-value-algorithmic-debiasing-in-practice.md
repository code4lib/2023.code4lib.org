title: "{key: value} : algorithmic debiasing in practice"
---
Algorithmic bias is familiar to many of us by now. Like, probably, you, I’ve read papers and watched talks on it for years now. And yet, when I sat down to code an interface that relied on machine learning, I realized I had plenty of questions – but no answers. As much as I’d learned about the big picture, I had no idea how to translate my values into the next line of code. When I looked for literature, I found lots of context, but nothing like a code sample. And yet, I still had decisions to make about interaction elements like autocomplete, or image display, or data visualization. How do I get from context to code? How do I implement these values?   In this talk, I’ll describe specific situations I faced, and the concrete questions of interface design they raised for me. I’ll ask a lot of questions. Perhaps you will have some of the answers.
