title: An Introduction to AWS
---
What is AWS? How would I get anything done in this mess? Why would I use it, and when would I not? Why does it let me talk to satellites and run little RC cars? I just want to deploy a website!  This beginner-friendly session will start with a basic overview of what AWS is, why it's so complex, and will plot a course through the wilderness so that you can get started building real functionality, and learn how to grow as your needs do.   Short labs will include topics such as static site hosting, infrastructure automation, running a database-backed web app, and using the built in content delivery network.   The instructor has built internet services in AWS for 10 years, and will be available in code4lib slack on an ongoing basis to answer questions and provide advice post-session!
