title: "Implementation of KOHA ILS in Libraries: A Developing Country Perspective"
---
This presentation aims to investigate the causes to choose Koha Integrated Library System (ILS), challenges in the implementation of Koha, and strategies to cope with these challenges. It used a qualitative research approach and data was collected through interviews. The population of the study was university librarians dealing with Koha ILS. Thematic analysis technique was used to analyse the data. The major reasons for choosing Koha ILS among professionals were its free availability, the opportunity of adopting a uniform platform, a user-friendly interface, and suitable to manage multiple campuses. Major challenges in the implementation of Koha ILS were a lack of an up-to-date hardware system, a complicated installation process, the non-availability of troubleshooting support, and a complicated process of data migration. Other challenges were backup problems, and unable to install it on the Windows platform. Professionals were using different strategies including the use of live DVDs instead of step-by-step installation, getting help from Koha communities, YouTube, and from professionals who have already implemented it along with the IT staff of the university. The finding of the current study helps formulate policies for higher authorities and provides guidelines for IT experts to devise tools to minimize challenges related to Koha ILS.
