title: "Utilizing R and Python for Institutional Repository Daily Jobs"
---
In recent years, the programming languages R and Python have become very popular among data
scientists. However, R and Python are not just for data scientists or programmers, they can also
help librarians to perform many tasks more efficiently and possibly achieve goals that were almost
impossible before. R and Python are scripting languages meaning they not very complicated. With
minimal programming experience, a librarian can learn how to program in these languages and start
to apply them to jobs. This article gives examples of utilizing R and Python to clean up metadata,
match transcripts with scanned images, and resize images for the Colorado State University
Institutional Repository.
