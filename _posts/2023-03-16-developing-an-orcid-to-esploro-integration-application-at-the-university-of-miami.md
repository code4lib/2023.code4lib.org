title: "Developing an ORCID to Esploro Integration Application at the University of Miami "
---
The University of Miami Libraries implemented Ex Libris Esploro as our Institutional Repository in
2021, and as part of this implementation the University of Miami (UM) started an initiative to
integrate ORCID iDs for researchers across the institution. Because not everyone at UM is a
researcher in Esploro, we needed a solution that could connect ORCID iDs for everyone independent
of Esploro, thus we developed the “ORCID Integration Tool”, a middleware application that could
handle all use cases. The app pulls ORCID data into Ex Libris Alma/Esploro via OAuth and API
connectors. This poster will outline the development process we took to build this app, including
the overall workflow: for example, Docker development environment, Azure pipelines, Python
libraries, Flask framework, and the results of user testing that led to a revision of the interface.
