title: '[Cancelled] - Building a Central Knowledge Graph for Digital Humanities Research Data'
---
The Max Planck Institute for the History of Science is developing a digital research platform to preserve and to integrate digital humanities research data and with library and archival systems used by the institute. The platform supports digitization of archival research materials into the library system (using Goobi) which is preserved and indexed (using Fedora, Solr, IIIF, and CDSTAR) and is linked to research data from projects in a central knowledge graph using linked data modelled with CIDOC-CRM (using Metaphacts Open Platform/ResearchSpace). This talk will discuss the use cases, design process, and challenges to create a platform to store data from multiple research projects. A short demo of the prototype will be included.
