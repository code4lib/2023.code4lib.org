title: "Transfer Library Data to Linked Art"
---
LUX (“light” from the Yale University’s Latin motto) is a multi-year project to find and connect
the Yale’s Cultural Heritage Collections across Yale University Art Gallery, Yale Center for
British Art, Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History and Yale University Library. LUX aggregates
metadata from the catalogs of Yale’s four main collections, over 50 million records—with a single
integrated search. How does Yale Library IT harmonize library data with archives and museum
metadata as Linked Open Data? The poster will demo the process of converting ArchivesSpace data
and ILS MARC data to Linked Art JSON_LD by implementing a flexible model in a Java Spring-based
application with Postgres. The application expresses library data as Linked Art entities and
exposes data through an Activity Stream. Transforming the library data at large scale into Linked
Data is challenging, especially in terms of data schema design and data storage. We will share the
lessons we learned from this project and also explore an alternative we are working on for data
delivery to LUX.
