A new National Institutes of Health (NIH) data management and sharing policy requires funded
investigators to share appropriate research data according to FAIR principles (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), and is effective in January 2023. In response, Weill Cornell
Medicine (WCM) Wood Library has developed a new tool named WIDRR – WCM Institutional Data
Repository for Research - aimed at helping WCM researchers deposit their datasets in a local
repository, so they are findable. WIDRR is used to deposit datasets for three milestones:
1) whenever a researcher publishes a paper, 2) when a researcher’s grant ends, or 3) when a
Principal Investigator leaves the institution. The tool is built with Django web framework and
based on a relational PostgreSQL database. It includes a 4-step wizard walking researchers through
the deposit process. This tool is connected to the WCM Data Catalog and allows researchers to
create a data catalog entry as they deposit (archive) their dataset. The data catalog entry
displays the metadata associated with the dataset, allowing each dataset to be visible by the
whole WCM community, thereby fostering the reuse of these datasets. This poster illustrates the
infrastructure and workflow which enable WCM researchers to meet this new policy requirement.
