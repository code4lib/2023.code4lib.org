title: "Thinking outside the box: Distributed architecture to meet new challenges for openly published research data"
---
Princeton University Library is performing software and data migration along with rapid
technological development with the goal of making sustainable, robust software to support our
digital repository service and to address the emerging needs of research data today and in the
future. Traditionally, options for this type of work include “boxed” systems that have
interdependent components for object storage, description, presentation, and preservation. These
systems often lack the flexibility to support emerging metadata standards, or to integrate with
other infrastructures, and tend to have brittle, extremely time-costly upgrade processes that can
result in data loss. This poster will cover our approach for supporting openly published research
data with our newly-developed software, as well as our efficient, flexible approach to creating an
ecosystem of services capable of being extended to connect with campus partners at Princeton and
beyond. In presenting our institution’s solution and future plans, we hope to generate a rich
discussion with others sharing these common problems in support of digital repositories.
