---
The Open Library Foundation is a non-profit organization that seeks to enable and support
collaboration among library workers, technologists, and service providers in order to share
expertise and resources for the creation of innovative software and resources that support
libraries. This poster will reflect on my two-year term as the Senior Program Officer for the Open
Library Foundation. It will highlight common themes across Foundation project communities, provide
a look inside open source governance, and discuss the benefits of volunteer opportunities such as
this one within open source projects.
